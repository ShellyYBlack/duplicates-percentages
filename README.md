# Get percentage of duplicates in a directory

This script calculates the percentage of duplicates in a directory compared to its sibling directories. combine_csvs.py will combine multiple siegfried.csv files into one file. dupe_percents_dir.py will create a CSV file showing the directory name, the percentage of duplicate files, number of duplicates, and number of files. It also shows whether the directory was already ingested into our preservation system by checking whether it is listed in a CSV that combines ingested siegfried.csv files.
